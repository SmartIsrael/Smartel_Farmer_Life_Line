Rice Disease Classification using Transfer Learning
Project Overview
In this project, I've implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning to classify rice plant diseases. My model is based on the VGG16 architecture and is trained to identify four types of rice diseases:

Bacterial Blight Disease
Blast Disease
Brown Spot Disease
False Smut Disease

Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (see Installation)

Installation
To set up the project environment, I recommend running the following commands:
bashCopypip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
Dataset
I've used a dataset stored in the ./Rice_Diseases directory. It contains images of rice plants affected by four different diseases. I've organized the dataset into subdirectories, each representing a disease category.
Project Structure
I've structured this project as a single Jupyter notebook that contains all the code for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
Usage
To use this project:

Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment.
Run all cells in order to execute the entire pipeline.
The notebook will load the data, preprocess images, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Model Architecture
For my model, I've used transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture:

Base: Pre-trained VGG16 (weights from ImageNet, without top layers)
Custom top layers I've added:

Flatten layer
Dense layer (512 units) with ReLU activation and L2 regularization
Dropout layer (50% rate)
Output Dense layer (4 units) with softmax activation



Training
I've trained the model using the following configuration:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Categorical Cross-entropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Data augmentation: Rotation, width/height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip
Callbacks:

EarlyStopping (monitors validation loss, patience of 10 epochs)
ReduceLROnPlateau (reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus)



Evaluation
To evaluate my model's performance, I've used:

Test set accuracy
Confusion matrix
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Results
My model achieved the following performance on the test set:

Test Accuracy: 91.18%

You can find detailed results in the confusion matrix and classification report generated in the notebook.
Future Improvements
While working on this project, I've identified several areas for potential improvement:

I could collect more diverse training data
Implementing cross-validation might help
Experimenting with different model architectures could yield better results
Fine-tuning hyperparameters might improve performance
Trying other regularization techniques could reduce overfitting
Implementing data augmentation techniques specific to plant disease images might enhance the model's robustness
